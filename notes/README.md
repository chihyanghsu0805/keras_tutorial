` Machine learning is essentially a form of applied statistics with increased emphasis on the use of computers to statistically estimate complicated functions and a decreasd emphasis on proving confidence intervals around these functions.` [1]

` A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.` [2]

` What separates machine learning from optimization is that we want the generalization error, also called the test error, to be low as well.` [1]
