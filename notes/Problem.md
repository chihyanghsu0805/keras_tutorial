ML problems can be catgorized into the following,

    -   `Classification` with discrete labels
    -   `Regression` with continuous labels

-   `Unsupervised` ML are used to find patterns in the data. Some examples are,

    -   `Clustering`
    -   Network Analysis
    -   Market Segmentation

-   `Reinforcement Learning` (RL): RL provides an environment to learn value and policy functions.
