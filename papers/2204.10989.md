-   Dialogue Meaning Representation for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems
    -   Slot filling is flat and is limited in compositional semantics, (conjunction, modification, negation, coreference)
    -   DMR is a DAG with nodes of Intent, Entity and pre-defined Operator and Keyword
    -   DMR uses `Inheritance Hierarchy` for domain-specific ontology
    -   Entity: <lexical_value> || <canonical_value> || entity, <> indicates optional
    -   Edges: for every edge the node types it can connect to is predefined
    -   Negation is tricky due to confusion of entity and order, limited to only entity
    -   Seq2Seq: Utterance -> linearized tree / graph
